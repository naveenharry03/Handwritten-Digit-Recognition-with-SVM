# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-SVM

This project focuses on solving the classic problem of handwritten digit recognition using Support Vector Machines (SVM). With a dataset containing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 and their corresponding pixel values as features, our aim to build a 10-class classification model. The MNIST dataset provides 784 features, corresponding to the 28x28 pixel images. By experimenting with SVM hyperparameters, we strive to achieve high accuracy in identifying the handwritten digits. Although neural networks havegained popularity in this domain, SVMs were once state-of-the-art and remain a valuable approach. Subsampling the large training dataset and judiciously tuning hyperparameters, we target an accuracy exceeding 90%, demonstrating the effectiveness of SVMs inthis pattern recognition task.
